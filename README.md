# Sonification Experiments
Experiments with turning data into sound

These experiments were done using [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) on a Mac as a hack day project at [.AstronomyX](https://www.dotastronomy.com/home-ten/) with Nuwanthika Fernando.
1. [Flare Sonification](flareSoundsOne.scd)  
   Using a GALEX light curve made with [gPhoton](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/gphoton/) and mapping photon count to pitch.
2. [Helix Nebula Sonification](nuwanthekaVideo.scd)  
   Sonification using the spectral data shown in figure 2 of [Etxaluze et al 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2014A&A...566A..78E/doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201322941). Unfortunately too terrifying/static to use with Nuwanthika's helix nebula video.
